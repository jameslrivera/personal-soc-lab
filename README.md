# Personal SIEM & Threat Monitoring Lab

A hands-on security operations center (SOC) lab that demonstrates end-to-end log and network data collection, visualization, and alerting using the Elastic Stack.

##  Overview

## Features

- Live, searchable log index in Elasticsearch  
- Pre-built dashboards for host health & network activity  
- Simple YAML configs and Docker Compose for rapid deployment  
- Easily extensible to add more Beats, IDS data, and alert rules
